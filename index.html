<p>Hi, my name is Remi, but you know me by my deadname, Bailey.</p><br>
</br> 
<p> I don't have a lot of web development/design experience, most of my experience is in HTML and CSS. I would like to learn how to build and develop websites effectively, and I hope to gain valuable skills that I can use towards my future job in the IT field. </p> <br>
</br>
<p> I would like to be able to apply my knowledge to future IT jobs, and to help my IT knowledge develop in growth and skill and give me a better toolset than I would've had had I not taken this course. </p>
